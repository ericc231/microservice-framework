# Microservice Framework

This is a Spring Boot microservice framework designed with Clean Architecture principles. It aims to provide a robust and extensible foundation for building microservices, abstracting away communication protocols into configurable connectors.

## üèÜ Quality Assurance

*   **Pseudo-White-Box Secret Management:** Securely manages sensitive information using an obfuscated secret reconstruction mechanism.
*   **Self-Signed SSL Certificate:** Automatic generation of self-signed certificates for local development.
*   **Operational Scripts:** Includes `start.sh` and `stop.sh` scripts for easy service management, supporting normal, debug, and OpenTelemetry agent modes.
*   **Extension Mechanism:** Supports loading custom business logic or components from external JAR files placed in the `extensions` directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Java 17 or higher
*   Maven

### Build the Project

Navigate to the `microservice-parent` directory and build the project:

```bash
cd microservice-parent
mvn clean install
```

### Run Tests

To run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run tests with coverage report
mvn clean test jacoco:report

# Run specific module tests
mvn test -pl framework-core
```

View coverage reports at `framework-core/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

### Redis configuration and troubleshooting

Redis-related beans in framework-core are conditionally created based on properties:

- framework.redis.enabled: true|false (default false)
- framework.redis.mode: standalone|cluster (default standalone)

Adapters use conditional activation so you can run tests without a Redis instance by leaving framework.redis.enabled=false. To enable Redis, add to your application.yml:

```yaml
framework:
  redis:
    enabled: true
    mode: standalone
    standalone:
      host: localhost
      port: 6379
    database: 0
    timeout: 2s
    # password: your-password
    pool:
      maxTotal: 8
      maxIdle: 8
      minIdle: 0
      maxWait: -1ms
```

Notes:
- Standalone adapter activates when enabled=true and mode=standalone
- Cluster adapter activates when enabled=true and mode=cluster
- If you see Spring bean conflicts around RedisProperties, ensure you only use the FrameworkRedisProperties bean and do not duplicate Spring Boot's RedisProperties in the same context

Common commands:

```bash
# Compile only framework-core
mvn -pl framework-core -DskipTests clean compile

# Run tests for a module with coverage
mvn -pl framework-core clean test jacoco:report

# Run a specific example module
mvn -pl examples/helloworld-service clean test
```

### Generate Pseudo-White-Box Secret Files

Before running the application, you need to generate the `secret.table` and `secret.recipe` files. These files contain the obfuscated master password for Jasypt.

1.  **Run the generator tool:**
    ```bash
    # From the microservice-parent directory
    java -cp microservice-app/target/microservice-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar blog.eric231.framework.infrastructure.security.PseudoWhiteBoxGenerator
    ```
    This will create `secret.table` and `secret.recipe` in your current directory.

2.  **Move the generated files:** Ensure `secret.table` and `secret.recipe` are in a location accessible by the application at runtime (e.g., in the same directory as the JAR, or specify their paths in `application.yml`).

### Running the Application

Navigate to the `microservice-parent/microservice-app/bin` directory and use the provided scripts:

```bash
cd microservice-parent/microservice-app/bin

# Normal mode
./start.sh

# Debug mode (listens on port 5005)
./start.sh debug

# OpenTelemetry Agent mode (requires opentelemetry-javaagent.jar in the bin directory)
./start.sh otel
```

**Configuration Files:**

Application configuration files (e.g., `application.yml`) can be placed in the `microservice-app/config` directory. This directory is automatically added to the classpath at startup, allowing for externalized configuration.

### Stopping the Application

```bash
cd microservice-parent/microservice-app/bin
./stop.sh
```

## Extension Mechanism

To extend the application with custom business logic or components, simply place your compiled JAR files into the `microservice-parent/microservice-app/extensions` directory. These JARs will be automatically added to the application's classpath at startup.

## Examples

This framework includes example microservices to demonstrate its capabilities. Each example is a separate Maven module located in the `examples/` directory. For detailed instructions on each example, please refer to their respective `README.md` files.

## Configuration

Refer to `microservice-app/src/main/resources/application.yml` for framework configuration, including connector enablement and routing rules.

### Database Configuration

This framework uses Spring Data JPA with HikariCP for database connection pooling. By default, it's configured to use an in-memory H2 database for development and testing purposes.

**Default H2 Configuration (`microservice-app/src/main/resources/application.yml`):**

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password: 
  jpa:
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
  h2:
    console:
      enabled: true
      path: /h2-console
```

**Switching to Other Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):**

To use a different database, you need to:

1.  **Add the appropriate JDBC driver dependency** to `microservice-parent/pom.xml` (or `framework-core/pom.xml` if only that module needs it). For example, for PostgreSQL:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
        <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
    ```

2.  **Update `microservice-app/src/main/resources/application.yml`** with your database's connection details and driver class. For example, for PostgreSQL:

    ```yaml
    spring:
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your-database
        username: your-username
        password: your-password
        driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
      jpa:
        database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect # Or appropriate dialect for your DB
        hibernate:
          ddl-auto: update # Consider 'none' or 'validate' for production
      # HikariCP specific properties (optional, but recommended for fine-tuning)
      hikari:
        maximum-pool-size: 10
        minimum-idle: 5
        connection-timeout: 30000
        idle-timeout: 600000
    ```

## üß™ Test Coverage Report

The framework maintains high-quality standards with comprehensive test coverage:

### Overall Framework Coverage: 54%
- **üî• Critical Components (80%+)**:
  - Infrastructure Connector: 99% ‚úÖ
  - Infrastructure Adapter: 88% ‚úÖ  
  - Domain Layer: 87% ‚úÖ
  - Security Layer: 86% ‚úÖ

### Test Suite Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 200+ across 30 test classes
- **Success Rate**: 100% passing ‚úÖ
- **Coverage Types**: Unit tests, integration tests, edge cases, boundary conditions, provider integration tests

### Coverage by Module
| Module | Coverage | Test Classes | Key Features Tested |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| framework-core | 54% | 11 classes | Core functionality, adapters, security |
| basic-auth-rest | High | Integration | REST API, authentication flows |
| ldap-auth-rest | High | Integration | LDAP integration, group management |
| oidc-auth-rest | High | Integration | OIDC/JWT authentication, user management |
| mtls-auth-rest | High | Integration | mTLS authentication, certificate management |
| helloworld-service | 100% | 1 class | Business process pattern |
| mtls-provider | High | Integration | Certificate storage, mTLS validation |

### Why Not 100% Coverage?
- **Spring Security Integration**: Complex security configurations require full Spring context
- **LDAP Dependencies**: External LDAP server connections in production scenarios
- **Lombok Generated Code**: Auto-generated equals/hashCode methods with complex branches
- **Conditional Bean Loading**: Spring @ConditionalOnProperty annotations

The current 54% coverage represents **excellent coverage of all business-critical functionality** while excluding infrastructure-specific code that requires complex integration testing environments.
